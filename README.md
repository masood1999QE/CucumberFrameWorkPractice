# CucumberFrameWorkPractice
Using this Repo to document my  learnings on Cucumber 
### Completed:
- Created a simple login feature file.	
- Implemented data-driven testing using Scenario Outline and Examples.
- Implemented Hooks and Step Definitions for the login feature.
- Applied the Factory Design Pattern to fetch the browser driver.
- Used the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to structure the test scripts.
- Created extent.properties file and integrated Extent Reporting.
- Used environment.properties for browser configuration and plan to extend it for other future configuration details.

### Yet to Start:
- Implement the Cucumber Dependency Injection (so we can pass the driver to steps definitons).
- Adding a Retry Mechanism
- Capturing screenshots for Failed Scenario Steps
- Jenkins Integration
