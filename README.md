# CucumberFrameWorkPractice
Using this Repo to document my  learnings on Cucumber 
Completed:
1.Created a simple login feature file.
2.Implemented data-driven testing using Scenario Outline and Examples.
3.Implemented Hooks and Step Definitions for the login feature.
4.Applied the Factory Design Pattern to fetch the browser driver.
5.Used the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to structure the test scripts.
6.Created extent.properties file and integrated Extent Reporting.
7.Used environment.properties for browser configuration and plan to extend it for other future configuration details.

Yet to Start:
1.Implementing Cucumber Dependency Injection (so we can pass the driver to steps definitons).
2.Adding a Retry Mechanism
3.Capturing screenshots for Failed Scenario Steps
4.Jenkins Integration
